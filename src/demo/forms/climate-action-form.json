Rising global temperatures are leading to more frequent and severe weather events, rising sea levels, biodiversity loss, and threats to food and water security. Scientific consensus indicates that limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels is critical to preventing the most catastrophic impacts. This requires rapid, far-reaching transitions in how we produce energy, manage land, build cities, and operate industrial systems.",
