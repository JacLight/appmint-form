# Icon Replacement Summary

## Overview

This project involved identifying and replacing non-Lucide icons with their Lucide equivalents in the codebase. The goal was to standardize icon usage across the application by using only Lucide icons.

## Process

1. **Icon Identification**: Used a script to find all icon names in the codebase.
2. **Non-Lucide Icon Extraction**: Identified non-Lucide icons based on their naming patterns (e.g., prefixes like Bs, Fa, Md).
3. **Icon Mapping**: Created a mapping of non-Lucide icons to their Lucide equivalents.
4. **Icon Replacement**: Replaced non-Lucide icons with their Lucide equivalents in the codebase.

## Results

- **Total Non-Lucide Icons Found**: 12
- **Total Replacements Made**: 12
- **Files Modified**: 6

### Non-Lucide to Lucide Icon Mapping

### Files Modified

1. src/library/common/page-search.tsx (2 replacements)
2. src/library/common/site-notification.tsx (4 replacements)
3. src/library/form-view/form-layout-slider.tsx (3 replacements)
4. src/library/form-view/form-popup.tsx (1 replacement)
5. src/library/table-view/column-head.tsx (1 replacement)
6. src/library/table-view/view-card-popup.tsx (1 replacement)

## Scripts Created

1. **find-icons.js**: Finds all icon names in the codebase.
2. **extract-non-lucide-icons.js**: Identifies non-Lucide icons based on their naming patterns.
3. **replace-icons.js**: Replaces non-Lucide icons with their Lucide equivalents in the codebase.

## Benefits

- **Standardized Icon Usage**: All icons now use the Lucide icon library, providing a consistent look and feel.
- **Simplified Maintenance**: Using a single icon library makes it easier to maintain and update icons in the future.
- **Improved Performance**: Reduces the need to load multiple icon libraries, potentially improving performance.
